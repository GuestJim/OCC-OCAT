These files are for the purpose of creating and processing CSVs that are the combination of multiple files. These original files could be covering different GPUs or different recordings. Currently the files are only for the latter.

The Python script asks for a GPU be named and is currently set to default to RX Vega 64, if none is provided. This is the GPU in my desktop and so should be changed if yours is different.
