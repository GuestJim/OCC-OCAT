# OCC-OCAT
My scripts for processing OCAT data and generating the scripts

Can just drag and drop the OCAT CSVs (and sometimes the CSVs from Radeon Adrenalin driver performance monitoring) to get the desired R scripts for processing

The Old folders have an older version of these, where a Batch file is used to call a Python script to create the desired R script
