# OCC-OCAT
My scripts for processing OCAT data and generating the scripts.
The Fully Commented branch has versions of the scripts where I comment almost line-by-line to explain how it all works.
Article covering all of the statistics, graphs, and scripts can be found here: https://github.com/GuestJim/Serious-Statistics-Reprocessed

Can just drag and drop the OCAT CSVs (and sometimes the CSVs from Radeon Adrenalin driver performance monitoring) to get the desired R scripts for processing

The Old folders have an older version of these, where a Batch file is used to call a Python script to create the desired R script
